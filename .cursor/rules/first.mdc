# Cursor Rules - Compact Guidelines

## üîç Essential Process Before Work

### Step 1: Project Structure Analysis
- Identify project type, tech stack, directory structure
- Analyze existing code style and patterns
- Check dependencies and configuration files

### Step 2: Work Plan Briefing (Mandatory)
```markdown
## üìã Work Plan Briefing
### Project Status
- Project Type: [Analysis Results]
- Tech Stack: [Identified Technologies]

### Request Analysis
- Work Content: [Request Summary]
- Impact Scope: [Files to be Modified/Added]

### Work Plan
1. [Step-by-step work plan]

**Will start work after approval.**
````

## üõ†Ô∏è Code Writing Principles

* **Concise and clean code** - Remove unnecessary complexity
* **Follow project flow** - Develop according to existing architecture
* **Prioritize function reuse** - Minimize new function creation, reuse existing ones
* **Consistent code style** - Strictly follow project conventions
* **Documentation comments required** - Add descriptions to all major components/functions
* Consider error handling and exception management

## üìù Work Completion Report

```markdown
## ‚úÖ Work Completion Report
### Work Performed: [Actual work content]
### Changed Files: [List of modified/added/deleted files]
### Key Changes: [Summary of core changes]
### Verification Items: [Items requiring confirmation]
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Precautions

* **Never start work without approval**
* **Write concise and clean code**
* **Follow project architecture and prioritize function reuse**
* **Maintain strict code style consistency**
* **Document all major components/functions**

## üåê Language Requirements

* **All communications, responses, and documentation in Korean**
* Code itself (variable names, function names) follows existing project conventions
* Technical terms may use English if commonly accepted in Korean dev environment

---

**Following these rules for systematic and safe development work, communicating in Korean.**
